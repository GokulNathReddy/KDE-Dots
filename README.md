### This is the Layan Dot-Files I made for XeroLinux

<h3 align="center">This is just a small taste of what XeroLinux is.<br /> For the whole experience you must <a href="https://xerolinux.xyz">install the Distro</a> & use it.</h3>

### Disclaimer

I also would like to clarify one very important aspect of ricing. Rice uses custom themes, and those might not get updated very often, if at all by their respective developers/artists, which might result in some parts of the system and apps not to get themed correctly. That, my friends, is unfortunately out of my hands.

### Performance :

This rice has been throughly optimized for best performance on higher-end systems.. Although it might work on lower-end ones, for better performance I do not recommend that you use it there. So please do not report any performance issues.

### Installation

Just git clone this repo and copy & paste below command nin terminal & run it that's it. Optimized to work on any **Arch-Based** Distro with **KDE-Plasma**...

```

### Side-Note :

> If you apply this rice and something goes wrong, well, that's not a fault of my own, it's just KDE being what it is, to remedy the situation, you are kindly requested to re-apply the rice again, that should fix it. Sorry about that but sometimes KDE can be a pain.. I still love it though ;)
